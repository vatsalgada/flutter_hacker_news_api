This Flutter application demonstrates my skills in mobile app development using Flutter and showcases my commitment to clean architecture principles. It fetches data from the Hacker News API and displays news articles in a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- [x] Clean Architecture: The app is designed following the clean architecture principles, which ensures a clear separation of concerns, making the codebase maintainable and scalable.

- [x] Dependency Injection: Utilizes the `get_it` package for dependency injection, making it easy to manage dependencies and facilitate unit testing.

- [x] BLoC Pattern: Utilizes the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern for state management, ensuring a predictable and robust user interface.

- [x] Data Fetching: The app fetches data from the Hacker News API using asynchronous operations and handles errors gracefully.

- [x] Offline Support: Implements local data caching to provide a seamless user experience even when the device is offline.

- [x] Responsive UI: The app is designed to adapt to different screen sizes and orientations, ensuring a consistent user experience on various devices.
